## Overview

This project implements sections from the provided Figma design into a responsive web page using Bootstrap 5. The focus was to leverage Bootstrap's grid system, components, and utilities to create a layout that remains true to the original design while ensuring cross-device compatibility and responsiveness.

Implemented Sections:
- Trending Courses: A showcase of popular courses with a horizontal scroll feature on mobile devices.
- Contact Section: An engaging call-to-action section with interactive buttons for users to get more information or contact the admissions team.

## Additional Features and Technologies

- Custom CSS: Used for detailed styling where Bootstrap's built-in classes were insufficient, such as specific alignment and custom shapes.
- Font Awesome: Icons from Font Awesome were used to enhance the visual appeal of buttons and links.
